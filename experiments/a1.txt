Carlos buys a new car. It's a very expensive car. It's a huge, blue, fast car. While driving down the street, Carlos sees a girl on a bicycle.  She has long blond hair and is beautiful.  He yells to her, "What's up?"
She ignores him.  He yells, "How's it going?"
She keeps going and ignores him.  He yells, "Hey, why won't you talk to me? I want to go to dinner with you. I'll take you to an expensive restaurant."
The girl turns, gets off the bike, and looks at him. She says, "I don't want to go to dinner. But if you give me your car, I will give you a surprise."
Carlos says, "OK!" He jumps out of the car. He gives her the keys and says, "Here are the keys." The beautiful blond takes the keys and then kisses Carlos on the cheek. Then she jumps into the car and drives away.
Carlos stands on the sidewalk. Now he has no car and no girl. He says, "That's it, just a kiss on the cheek?" He gets on her bike and rides home.
