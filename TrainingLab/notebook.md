# Lessons Learned
- Place utterance action immediately after intention
- One example leads to unexpected behavior because it easily might be interfered by other cases
- Slot has weight -> [0, 1] and feature (dimension)
- To be mindful of the symmetry of intention-case frequency in between many stories
- To be mindful of over learning.
- To be mindful of values loss and acc, when acc quickly reaches 1 but loss still hight, experience in practice has shown that it's time to make the NN bigger or deeper
- To strength the flow of scrips, make the representative vector of feature slot bigger and denser
- Bigger max_history makes result worse
- Low max_history value may make model focuses on slots and entities feature more than long history
- MemoizationPolicy somehow has relation to TEDPolicy, because when not registered the performance of Core significantly affected. (implicitly they should be independent according to the document)
- Increasing 'max_history' has impact on model's performance (higher action prediction confidence)
- When prediction confidence is low, making NN bigger is good to try
- Lower value of epoch may make model less confidence when predicting but may make model "smarter" (better in  processing abstract data)
- Increase the size of slots feature to balance with the size of sbert wordvector
- The acc metrics of training time is very good (0.99) but the performance at testing time is not correct in repsect to story's instruction, is that because the training story is composed improperly??
- The higher acc value the higher prediction confidence value
- Increase the size of dense dimension layer can improve the training acc.
- Increse the size of dialogue block of trainsform layer can improm the training acc.
